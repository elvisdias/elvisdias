### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working for a state-owned company as a Data Analyst/Engineer; 
- :mortar_board: Finishing a post graduation on data analysis; 
- :bulb: Also learning javascript (on the flow) to showcase personal projects on my personal website;
- :telescope: Looking forward to being a good professional workin with data analysis and engineering;
- :bookmark_tabs: GitHub preference: I don't commit anything I'm doing at the moment, rather I prefer to keep my profile clean to what matters most;
- âš¡ Fun fact: My name is not Presley, just Elvis haha.
